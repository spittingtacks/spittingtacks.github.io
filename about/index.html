			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I went to the University of Texas at Austin, I studied Geography and English, I work as a freelance motion graphic designer and technical writer in Los Angeles. This means that I like making pretty things that move for television and write about complicated things for computers, blogs, software manuals and such. In the city of Los Angeles, I spend time exploring the amazing intersections of world cultures, enjoy drawing, like taking pictures, and eating good food. In my free time, I'm training for the AIDS Lifecycle June 2016, I volunteer, and make myself go on at least one date a month in the hopes of finding love. My apartment won't let me have pets, otherwise I'd totally have a dog.</p>
